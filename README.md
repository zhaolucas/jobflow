## Introduction

This is the second and final group project for the front-end web development bootcamp. 

Our group has used everything we have learned to create a real-world front-end application that we will be able to showcase to potential employers. Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a front-end web developer. This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers our collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused React app. 

We conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating this collaborative front-end, application, we’ll create a React front end to build a user-focused platform. We’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies. These include storing code in GitHub, managing with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

For this project, we start from scratch. Doing so will allow us to revisit your front-end abilities in the context of React. 

APIs: final ones used.

`User Story:`  
`As a job seeker after a bootcamp,`  
`I want a platform where I can not only search for relevant job opportunities but also track my job applications and progress,`  
`So that I can manage my job search more efficiently and increase my chances of landing a job that matches my skills and aspirations.`
